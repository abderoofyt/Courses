Algorithm 1: Find Largest Number

While number_entered is not equal to zero:
    prompt user to "Enter positive number? (ends with 0[zero])
    if number_entered > largest_number:
        largest_number is equal to number_entered
    else When number_enters == 0:
        print(largest_number)

Algorithm 2: Greet User

prompt "Enter your name? " and store first_name
print "Hello, Wolrd! + first_name

Algorithm 3: Calculate Arithmetic Average

prompt "Enter integers one by one (type DONE to finish): "
