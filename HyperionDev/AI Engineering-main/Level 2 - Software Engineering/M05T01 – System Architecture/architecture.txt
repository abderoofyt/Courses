Real-World Examples of Architecture Patterns

1. Layered (N-Tier) Architecture
Example: Online Banking Systems (e.g., Wells Fargo)
When to Use: Best for systems that require separation of concerns and work in tiers (presentation, business logic, data access).
Why Appropriate: Banks require clear division between user interface, business rules (e.g., transaction validation), and data storage (e.g., customer accounts). This improves maintainability, security, and testing.

2. Client-Server Architecture
Example: Email Applications (e.g., Microsoft Outlook with Exchange Server)
When to Use: Suitable when multiple clients need to access shared resources or data hosted on a central server.
Why Appropriate: The client-server model enables multiple email clients to interact with a central server for storing, sending, and receiving emails, ensuring consistency and centralized control.

3. Microservices Architecture
Example: Netflix
When to Use: Best for large-scale systems requiring scalability and independent deployment of components.
Why Appropriate: Netflix splits its services (e.g., recommendations, user profiles, playback) into microservices, allowing individual scaling, development, and fault isolation, which is critical for millions of global users.

4. Event-Driven Architecture
Example: E-commerce Platforms (e.g., Amazon)
When to Use: Ideal for systems needing high responsiveness, real-time processing, and scalability.
Why Appropriate: In Amazon, events like adding items to cart, checking out, and stock updates are handled as discrete events. This pattern allows asynchronous communication and fast reaction times.

5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)
Example: Government e-Services Portals
When to Use: Works well for integrating various systems and services across departments or organizations.
Why Appropriate: Different departments (e.g., tax, health, transport) can expose services (e.g., verify ID, retrieve records), enabling reuse and flexible integration.

Combined Architecture Examples
1. Netflix – Microservices + Event-Driven
Strengths:

High scalability and modularity.
Real-time responsiveness and resilience.
Teams can work on different services independently.

Limitations:
Increased complexity in communication and monitoring.
Requires advanced infrastructure (e.g., service discovery, logging, message queues).

2. Uber – Client-Server + Microservices
Strengths:
Reliable central coordination (client-server) with scalable backend services (microservices).
Easy updates and flexible deployment of individual features (like ride tracking, payments).

Limitations:
Potential latency due to service calls.
More effort needed to handle consistency and data synchronization.
